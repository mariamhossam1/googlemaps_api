This was a task at Uni which required me to embed Google Maps to your HTML web page using JavaScript.
Create a web page for a Location Finder that finds locations of a specified place (first input box) within a given number of
kilometers (second input box) from your location (that should be automatically generated).
It should all show as red pins on the Google Maps you embedded in the web page.
